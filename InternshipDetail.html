                <h2>KPMG Data Analytics Internship</h2>
                &emsp;&emsp;
                I was eager to begin my internship at a large tech company. Data science has always piqued my
                attention, and I was keen to learn more about it.

                My initial responsibility was to evaluate the data's quality for the organization. This involves finding
                and fixing any mistakes or discrepancies in the data. Although it was a difficult task, I was able to
                enhance the data's quality by using my expertise in data cleaning and wrangling.
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;
                After the data had been cleaned, I could begin searching for insights. Statistical analysis, machine
                learning, and natural language processing were just a few of the data analysis methods I employed. In
                the data, I was able to spot patterns and trends that were not immediately apparent.

                Finally, I presented my results to stakeholders using my expertise in data visualization. I produced a
                range of data visualizations, such as graphs, maps, and charts. These visualizations allowed me to make
                the data more approachable and understandable.
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;

                My internship was a fantastic educational opportunity. I was able to use my data science expertise to
                solve actual issues. I also gained a lot of knowledge about the data science and IT industries. I am
                appreciative of the chance to have served as an intern at this business, and I am eager to advance my
                data science career.

                <h2>British Airways Data Science Internship</h2>
                &emsp;&emsp;
                My first task was to use web scraping to collect data from a variety of websites. This involved using a
                variety of tools and techniques to extract data from the websites. It was a challenging task, but I was
                able to use my skills in programming and data wrangling to collect the data.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;

                Once the data was collected, I was able to use it to predict customer behavior. I used a variety of
                machine learning techniques to build models that could predict how customers would behave in the future.
                I was able to use these models to improve the company's marketing and sales efforts.

                Finally, I used my skills in feature engineering and modeling to create a machine learning model that
                could predict customer churn. This model was able to identify customers who were at risk of leaving the
                company. The company was able to use this information to take steps to prevent customers from
                churning.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;

                My internship was a great learning experience. I was able to apply my skills in data science to
                real-world problems. I also learned a lot about the tech industry and the data science field. I am
                grateful for the opportunity to have interned at this company, and I am excited to continue my career in
                data science.
