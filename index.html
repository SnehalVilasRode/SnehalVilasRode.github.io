				<h1>Snehal Vilas Rode</h1>
				<p> In February 2019, I first became conscious while watching Sundar Pichai's YouTube video titled 'Why Machine Learning is the Future.' He claims that the two key factors contributing to the advancement of ML are access to more relevant data and improved processing power. Working with data has always made me feel energized, whether it be data mining, data analysis, or data visualization and enhancing it with ML techniques or data storage. After completing my master's, I aspire to work as a Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst. In the long term, I envision myself as a data scientist because D.J. Patil, the first chief data scientist ever appointed by the US government and a former chief data scientist at the White House, is a tremendous inspiration to me. His emphasis on fostering inquiry, teamwork, and solving social and local issues consistently fuels my desire to work as a CDS.

Throughout my undergraduate career, I engaged in various extracurricular activities. Participation in competitions and event management has honed my decision-making skills while also bringing a sense of calm and poise. My leadership roles, including serving as a Head-Girl in my school and President of the department during my undergrad, have further empowered me in terms of decision-making capabilities. I am a dedicated and adaptable engineer with experience in the field of machine learning. I am proficient in data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau, enabling me to create engaging interactive dashboards with clear and concise findings. I believe in my ability to solve problems effectively, excel as a technical writer, and possess excellent communication skills. My commitment is to exceed goals and expectations.

				<h2>Exploratory projects</h2>
				<p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world. It
					is really important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around
					him or her. I have been coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my
					knowlegde, creativity, math and confidence.

						<h3>Machine Learning Projects</h3>
						<p>I have implemented some of the projects using the following machine learning algorithms, and
							here is a summary explanation of each algorithm that I understand:<br>


							<b>1) Linear regression:</b> used to predict a continuous value, such as price or
							weight.<br>
							<b>2) Logistic regression:</b> useful when we need to predict a binary value, such as yes or
							no.<br>
							<b>3) Decision trees:</b> can be used to make decisions based on a set of rules.<br>
							<b>4) Support vector machines:</b>used to classify data into two or more categories.<br>
							<b>5) K-nearest neighbors:</b> is designed for finding the most similar data points to a
							given
							data
							point.<br>
							<b>6) Naive Bayes:</b> classify data based on the probability of each class.

						<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
						<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a critical and vital step in any data analysis project. It
							really helps me get a better understanding of data, identify patterns and trends, and clean
							up any errors or inconsistencies. As a part of EDA I have performed below steps <br>
							<b>1) Data visualization:</b> I always prefer analyzing each feature using charts, graphs,
							and other visuals to get more details about data.<br>
							<b>2) Statistical analysis:</b> This involves using statistical methods to calculate summary
							statistics and test hypotheses about data.<br>
							<b>3) Data cleaning:</b> removing errors and
							inconsistencies.<br>
							<b>4) Data transformation:</b> Handling Null values, Converting the datatype to its
							appropriate dtype

						<h3>Power BI Visualization</h3>
						<p>
							I really enjoy working with Power BI as it helps me to analyze and visualize data. It is a
							powerful tool that can help make better decisions, improve business, and drive growth.

							Here are my few dashboard along with screenshot where I have performed<br>

							<b>1) Connect to data sources:</b> Connected to various source such as Excel, SQL Server,
							Azure SQL Database,
							Oracle, SAP, and Salesforce.<br>
							<b>2) Clean and prepare your data:</b> Power BI makes it easy to clean and prepare your
							data.some of the operations that I performed such as removeing duplicates, fill in missing
							values, and transform your data into a
							format that is suitable.<br>
							<b> 3) Create visualizations:</b> created charts, graphs, and other visuals that helped me
							to understand data.<br>
							<b>4) Share your insights:</b> Finally to make it availble I have
							published reports to the web, shared them with stakeholder via email, or embeded them in
							website or intranet.

						<h3>Scalable Database</h3>
						<p>I am experienced in handling below type of dataset<br>
							<b>1) NoSQL databases:</b> NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data
							without the need for a traditional relational database structure. They are often used for
							storing unstructured data, such as social media posts or sensor data.<br>
							<b>2) Distributed databases:</b> Distributed databases are spread across multiple servers,
							which allows them to scale horizontally. This means that they can be easily expanded by
							adding more servers.<br>
							<b>3) Cloud-based databases:</b> Cloud-based databases are hosted on the cloud, which means
							that they can be accessed from anywhere. This makes them ideal for businesses that need to
							be able to access their data from multiple locations.

						<h3>Email Classification</h3>
						<p>Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They
							typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in
							text classification.
							Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes
							other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a
							probability that an email is or is not spam.</p>

							important. To improve my confidence, public speaking, and networking abilities, I joined
							several clubs and organizations throughout my academic career. Technical and non-technical
							knowledge are both significant in today's society. Below, I've listed some of my skills and
							the organizations I've participated in so far.
