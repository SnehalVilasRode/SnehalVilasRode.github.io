				<h1>Snehal Vilas Rode</h1>
				<p> In February 2019, I first became conscious while watching Sundar Pichai's YouTube video titled 'Why
					Machine Learning is the Future.' He claims that the two key factors contributing to the advancement
					of ML are access to more relevant data and improved processing power. Working with data has always
					made me feel energizing, whether it be data mining, data analysis, or data visualization and
					highlighting it with ML techniques or data storage. After completing my master's, I want to work as
					a machine learning engineer. In the long term, I see myself working as a data scientist because D J
					Patil, the first chief data scientist ever appointed by the US government and a former chief data
					scientist at the White House, is a tremendous inspiration to me.
					His emphasis on fostering inquiry, teamwork, and social and local issue solving consistently makes
					me yearn to work as a CDS. Over the course of my undergraduate career, I participated in a variety
					of extracurricular activities. Basketball participation and event management have enhanced my
					decision-making skills while also calming and settling me down. My ability to lead throughout my
					time as a Head-Girl in my school and President of the department during my undergrad has also
					empowered me in terms of my ability to make decisions. I am a dedicated and adaptable engineer with
					experience in the field of machine learning. experienced in designing ML algorithms, developing
					final prediction models, and data extraction. I think that I am a strong problem solver, technical
					writer and have excellent communication skills. I am dedicated to exceeding goals and expectations.

				<h2>Exploratory projects</h2>
				<p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world. It
					is really important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around
					him or her. I have been coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my
					knowlegde, creativity, math and confidence.

						<h3>Halma Game Playing Agent</h3>
						<p>The game of Halma, an adversarial game with some similarities to checkers. The game uses a
							16x16 checkered gameboard.
							Each player starts with 19 game pieces clustered in diagonally opposite corners of the
							board. To win the game, a player needs to
							transfer all of their pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner, into the
							positions that were initially occupied by the opponent.

						<h3>Email Classification</h3>
						<p>Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They
							typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in
							text classification.
							Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes
							other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a
							probability that an email is or is not spam.</p>
